## NOTE
Firmware updates may remove the <b>bl_macros.cfg</b> file and the edit made to <b>printer.cfg</b><br>
If your macros are not in the list after a firmware update you will need to add the <b>bl_macros.cfg</b> and edit the <b>printer.cfg</b> again to restore them.

## XS3002

If you have installed this and update the printer you might get an error <b>XS3002</b> on screen.<br>
This means klipper has failed to start and is likely caused by the update removing the <b>bl_macros.cfg</b> but not the entry for it in the <b>printer.cfg</b> file.<br>
To solve it upload the <b>bl_macros.cfg</b> file again or remove the `[include bl_macros.cfg]` entry in <b>printer.cfg</b><br>
